    Who will visit your site: anybody interested in underground music.
    Who are your competitors in similar industries: other record labels, as well as online distributors.
    What can make you and/or your product stand out against your competitors: good workflow on the website, good album covers, and of course, good music.
    How would you speak to your clientele if you were communicating in person? How could you translate that style and tone digitally: once again, the workflow would be consistent with the outlines of the business.
    What colors represent your restaurant/business: off colors for the body of the page, a beige background. . . and very bright album covers to highlight the products. . .
    What images illustrate your message: the logo, plus the album covers.
