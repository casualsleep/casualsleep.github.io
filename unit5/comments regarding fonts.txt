screenshot 1 is a josephine font. it is a bit out of place with the content and color scheme. possibly too cute for the content.

screenshot 2 is just right. similar to the font used at the beginning of blade runner. 
it is a serif font, it stands out, and the distribution is great. 
but it highlights that i should use a different color scheme as a background, and for the fonts.
